## Hello! Today we are going to do another coding Relay! 
#### These are the groups: 
* Group 1: James, TA, Max
* Group 2: Hank, Kevin, Rory
* Group 3: Taixi, Reiko, Paddy

### Your Relay challenge is as follows: 
#### Create a Guess-the-number Game using a while True loop. It should include the following elements: 
* First print something like "Can you guess the number? Your odds are one in a million!"
* You should choose the magic number between 1-1,000,000
  * Basically, YOU create a variable for the magic number. 
* The program should include a while True loop
* If the guess is too high, say "Too high!" If the guess is too low, say "too low!"
  * You will need to use IF statements here in order to compare the users input to the magic number. 
* The program should continue to ask the user to a guess until they get it correct.
  * After the guess correctly, the loop should end! How do you do this? 
* Lastly, include a counter that will tell the user how many tries it took them to guess. 

> USE PAPER AND PENCIL TO MAP OUT A PROGRAM! WORK AS A TEAM SO YOU KNOW WHAT YOU SHOULD BE WRITING EACH TIME YOU GO TO THE COMPUTER
