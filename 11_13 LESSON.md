### Hello Everyone. I am sorry I cannot be in class today. Your task for today is slightly different. You will be doing a mini research project. 

#### For your project, I want you to use this website as a starting point. (You have to scroll a ways to get to the 12 uses) https://www.upgrad.com/blog/python-applications-in-real-world/ 

#### Your task is submit a 1 page document that does the following: 
* Describes 4 out of 12 of the examples listed in the article. What are these uses? Do any of them interest you?
* Please find at least 5 words that you do not know. See if you can find a definition for those words that makes sense to you. If the definitions seem to complicated, try a different word! Sometimes finding definitions of new coding terms can get complicated. This is normal. Being able to find definitions on your own is a powerful skill. 
* Finally, if you had to pick to pick one of these 12 examples as your job, which one would you choose? Why?

#### Please upload your document to Canvas when you are finished. See you Wednesday!
