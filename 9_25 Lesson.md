## Today we will share projects, and then work on debugging a section of code. 


#### For a challenge today, debug the following code: 
```
print("100 Code QUIZ")
print()
print("How many can you answer correctly?)
ans1 = ("What language are we writing in?")
if ans1 == "python":
  print("Correct")
else:
  print("NopeðŸ™ˆ
ans2 = input("Which lesson number is this?")
if(ans2>12):
print("We're not quite that far yet")
else
  print("We've gone well past that!")
elif(ans2==12)
  print("That's right!")
```

### For today's challenge: Can you create the Rock, Paper, Scissors game using python? Use this code to start. 
### (The first line makes it so player 1 and player 2's selections are hidden)

```
from getpass import getpass as input

print("are you ready for an epic match??\n It is time to play ROCK PAPER SCISSORS. \n \n Select your move: R P S")

Player_1 = input("Player 1... R, P, or S? \n\t")
Player_2 = input("Player 2... R, P, or S? \n\t")
```
