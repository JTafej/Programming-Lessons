### You're in for a treat! Today we are talking about While loops. We will learn about other loops later, but you will soon discover that loops are a very powerful tool in programming. 

#### So what is a while loop? It is a way to run a program over and over again until a certain condition is met.

#### For example, try running the following code that was demonstrated by our brave volunteer. 

```
counter = 0
while counter < 10:
  print(counter)
  counter +=1
```
#### You will see that the code will run until counter = 10. Amazing. Can you make the program count to 100 instead? 

##### Try running this code. What happens? 
```
exit = ""
while exit = "yes":
  print("ðŸ¥³")
exit = input("Exit?: ")
```

##### Ah! The "Exit" question was not IN the while loop in that code. See the code below for the correct format for a while loop. 
```
exit = ""
while exit = "yes":
  print("ðŸ¥³")
  exit = input("Exit?: ")
```
