## Hello Everyone! Today we will be beginning a group project, that will last the week. You should begin by sharing your last project with your group members. After you have seen what others completed, you should start thinking about what you could make together if you combined forces. 

### You will need to fill out a form that details what exactly it is your group will be attempting to create. You will need to present your project together at the end of the day on Thursday, as if you were advertising the product to a potential new user.
