## Please start class today by working with your groups to solve the prompts. 


## Challenge 1 for today: Create a log in website that generates a strong password, and then saves the password to be associated with that specific user. You will need to use lists and random at a minimum. The password should have at least two lowercase letters, two numbers, two uppercase letters, and a special character like (!#@$%^&*). Below is an example of a flowchart for generating this unique password.

## Challenge 2! Can you make a tic tac toe came with just python text? You will need to format your python output to print things nicely. You may want to use 3 seprarate lists, one for each line. Start with blank spaces, and fill them with O and X as requested by the user. 

## Both challenges are due today, don't use ChatGPT!
