## Please start class today by working with your groups to solve the prompts. 


## Challenge for today: Create a log in website that generates a strong password, and then saves the password to be associated with that specific user. You will need to use lists and random at a minimum. The password should have at least two lowercase letters, two numbers, two uppercase letters, and a special character like (!#@$%^&*).
