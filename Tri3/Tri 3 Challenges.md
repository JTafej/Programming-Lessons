## Please start class today by working with your groups to solve the prompts. 


## Challenge 1 for today: Create a log in website that generates a strong password, and then saves the password to be associated with that specific user. You will need to use lists and random at a minimum. The password should have at least two lowercase letters, two numbers, two uppercase letters, and a special character like (!#@$%^&*). Below is an example of a flowchart for generating this unique password.

## Challenge 2! Can you make a tic tac toe came with just python text? You will need to format your python output to print things nicely. You may want to use 3 seprarate lists, one for each line. Start with blank spaces, and fill them with O and X as requested by the user. 

## Both challenges are due today, don't use ChatGPT!


## UPDATE FOR 2/28. Today, you will create both of these projects again, as a group of 2 or 3. You will have the full period to enhance your current projects, and should be ready to answer the following questions at the end of the period: 
* How was your project improved from Monday?
* How is it the same?
* What is one new thing you learned about today?

### Note, improving your project may require you to look some things up on the internet. If you are having understanding any resources, just ask!
