# Your challenge for today is to complete at least 4 of these online python challenges. They may take some research to figure out! Feel free to ask me or use the internet, but avoid chatgpt, as you will not learn anything from that. 

## After you are done, take a screenshot of the 4 that you completed and upload it to the assignment on Canvas.
