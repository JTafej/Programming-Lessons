## Your first task for today is to explore this website: https://www.w3schools.com/ 
### You should find that is an extremely valuable resource for learning to code in any language. Spend some time doing challenges on the python tab, and maybe even try some for other languages. Take note of similarities and differences between python and other languages!

## Your challenge for today is to complete at least 4 of these online python challenges. They may take some research to figure out! Feel free to ask me or use the internet, but avoid chatgpt, as you will not learn anything from that. 

## After you are done, take a screenshot of the 4 that you completed and upload it to the assignment on Canvas.
